# Dune
All-in-one data management platform that allows you to govern your data infrastructures more easily.

Requirement: python3.8 \
Recommended IDE: PyCharm \
Recommended Tools: Postman

## Developer Guide

### Setup

To start with, please set up your python environment. In this project, we will use virtual environment.
```commandline
python -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate (macOs)
.\venv\Scripts\activate (windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Above commands will help you to install required packages. Since we are using Heroku as our deployment platform,
if you want to add any dependency, **please dump that to the requirement.txt file by:**
```commandline
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Development
1. After adding new features, please deploy and test Dune app locally before push.
```commandline
heroku local
```
* If you don't have heroku command yet, please install it by
```commandline
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
```
2. Use your Postman to send out API requests.
3. After finishing developing, just do `git push` to deploy your code.
